# Brick_Breaker
A take on the classic game brick breaker. 

The goal of the game is to eliminate all the bricks before you lose all three lives.
The way you lose a life is if the ball goes past the user controlled paddle. 
The controls are the arrow keys(up, down, left, right).
There are three levels, easy, medium and hard. The user will specify
what level difficulty they want to play in the console. The board for that
difficulty will then appear on the screen. Hitting the oval is good and will
give you an advantage with a bigger ball. Hitting the line is bad and will
make it more challenging with a much smaller ball.

Good luck and have fun!!
